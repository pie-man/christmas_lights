# christmas_lights
Python code to operate a set of lights on the office Christmas tree.

Currently being reconfigured to use a pimoroni plasma stick (pico W on-board)

A string of lights can be broken down into 3 'rings' and the patterns assigned to each ring.
'Actor's are created to shift through the patterns in a fixed number of steps.
Be that fadeing in or out or lighting the pixels up succewsively.
